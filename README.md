# a-cute.tv

dumb synchronized video stream

## Installation

It _actually does_ need ffmpeg, so your server needs to have that installed. Other than that, the dependencies are in the shard.yml file.
simply run:
```
shards install
crystal build --release src/acutetv.cr && ./acutetv
```
in the folder, and bada bing bada boom the shit should run!

## Development

I need all the help i can get. I suck at this.
